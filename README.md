🚀 Overview
Visiontegral is a high-performance computational framework engineered for deep-void mathematical integration. It provides a robust infrastructure for solving non-trivial calculus problems with absolute precision, bridging the gap between theoretical singularities and production-grade engineering.
🛠 Architecture
The system is partitioned into independent kernels to ensure maximum scalability and low-latency processing:
Core Engine: Recursive quadrature algorithms designed for complex variables.
Utility Layer: Optimized data structures for ensuring mathematical consistency across threads.
Visual Renderer: specialized layer for mapping computational results into high-fidelity visuals.
⚡️ Quick Start
Initialize the environment and execute high-precision tasks with minimal overhead:
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/visionis/visiontegral.git

# Install core dependencies
cd visiontegral && pip install -r requirements.txt

import visiontegral as vi

# Initialize the infinite depth engine
engine = vi.Core.Engine(precision="ultra")
result = engine.solve("exp(-x^2)", limits=(-inf, inf))

🌌 Computational Depth
The intersection of mathematical depth and architectural integrity. Every operation within the kernel is audited for maximum precision.
