## System Overview
Visiontegral is a high-performance computational framework engineered for deep-void mathematical integration. It eliminates the friction between theoretical complex analysis and production-grade engineering, providing absolute precision for non-trivial calculus problems.

<br>

## Architecture
Built on a modular kernel for maximum scalability:

* **Visiontegral.Core** — High-precision integration algorithms for complex variable analysis.
* **Visiontegral.Utils** — Optimized data structures ensuring mathematical consistency.
* **Visiontegral.Visual** — Depth-oriented rendering layer for high-fidelity result mapping.

<br>

## Computational Intelligence
Visiontegral operates at the edge of mathematical possibility. By utilizing non-linear quadrature kernels and recursive stability audits, the framework transforms abstract singularities into actionable engineering data. This is not just integration; it is the architectural mastery of the infinite.
