# System Overview
Visiontegral is a high-performance computational framework engineered for deep-void mathematical integration. It provides a robust infrastructure for solving non-trivial calculus problems with absolute precision, bridging the gap between theoretical singularities and production-grade engineering.
# Architecture
The system is partitioned into independent, high-integrity kernels to ensure low-latency processing and maximum scalability:
Visiontegral.Core — Symbolic and numerical integration engines utilizing recursive quadrature.
Visiontegral.Utils — Optimized data structures for maintaining mathematical consistency.
Visiontegral.Visual — A specialized rendering layer for high-fidelity result mapping.
Installation and Deployment
Initialize the environment and execute complex tasks via the standard CLI:
